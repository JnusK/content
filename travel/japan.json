            "I took a solo trip to the foothills of Mt. Fuji in search of plum blossoms and shots of the famous volcano.",
            "I booked a hostel  directly opposite the train station at Kawaguchiko. The hostel was almost empty and I had the entire 6 people dorm to myself. The bathroom has great views overlooking the train station and Mt. Fuji.",
            "Sadly,  my first full day at Kawaguchiko was totally fogged up due to rain and I coulf not see the peak. However, it gave me time to visit the sake plant where I learnt that amazake, a drink that I discovered in Japan, is actually a by-product from the sake manufacturing process.",
            "I manage to rent an electric bicycle and set off at 5AM the next morning to catch the sun rise at Chureito Pagoda. There is a public carpark at the bottom of the pagoda and bicycle parking is available there. The pagoda is closed and fenced up, but the view of Mt. Fuji behind it was great as the sun iluminated the scene.",
